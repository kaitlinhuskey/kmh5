		<h1>Offense: Attacking</h1>
		<h4>Here is everything you need to know about volleyball!</h4>
		<h5>Volleyball is a sport for both men and women, that has a maximum of six players playing at a time.</h5>
		<hr>
	<ul>
		<h3>How it's done:</h3>
		<li>Attacking is a form of offense that is done at the net towards the other side of the net to the other team</li>
		
	<ul>

		<h2>The basics:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>An approach is made to the net, giving the player momentum to jump and hit the ball with highest potential</li>
		<li>The best way to hit the ball is when it is at its peak height from the setter's hands</li>
		<li>After leaving the hitter's hand, if done correctly, the ball should go down and either hit the court in-bounds or dug up from the other team</li>
		<li>Most times, after an attack is hit, it ends the rally when the defenders can't keep the ball in play</li>
		
	</ol>
