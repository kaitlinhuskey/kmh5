	<ul>
		<h3>How it's done:</h3>

		<h2>The basics: Defense and offense</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Defensively, it is done when the opposing team attacks the ball, and the defenders passing the ball have to keep the ball from hitting the ground</li>
		<li>Offensively, it is either overhead passing to set to a hitter, or sending the ball over with a pass when there is no option for an offensive attack</li>
		
		
	</ol>
