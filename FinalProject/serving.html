		<h4>Here is everything you need to know about volleyball!</h4>
		<h5>Volleyball is a sport for both men and women, that has a maximum of six players playing at a time.</h5>

	<ul>
		<h3>Starting a rally:</h3>
		<li>Serving is how a rally is started in volleyball, and the first chance to get a point</li>

		<h2>The basics:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>It is done when a rally ends, after a point is given, and when a new rally is starting, the team that earned the point gets to serve</li>
		<li>The players rotate serving each rally and serve behind the out-of-bounds line</li>
		<li>The way to serve is shown above: tossing the ball up, taking a step or lunging forward and rotating the whole body to hit the ball with full force to get it over the net</li>
		<li>Another way to serve is to jump serve, and tossing the ball up higher than a standing serve, and doing an attacking approach to hit the ball as high as possible to get a fast (hopefully hard to return) serve to the opponent</li>
		
	</ol>
